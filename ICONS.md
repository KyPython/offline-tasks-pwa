# PWA Icons

This app requires PWA icons for installation. You need to create two icon files:

1. **icon-192.png** (192x192 pixels)
2. **icon-512.png** (512x512 pixels)

Place these files in the `public/` directory.

## Quick Icon Generation

You can use online tools like:
- https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- https://favicon.io/

Or create them manually using any image editor. The icons should:
- Be square (1:1 aspect ratio)
- Have a transparent or solid background
- Represent the app (e.g., a task/checklist icon)
- Be clear and recognizable at small sizes

## Temporary Solution

For development, you can use placeholder icons or skip the manifest icons temporarily. The app will still work, but PWA installation may not be available without proper icons.
